# MATDRAB2MATFAB

Repository for resources, codes, and data associated to an intro to MATLAB and Statistics class.
This course will take you from MATDRAB to MATFAB in 8 sessions.
See below for a description of each class and the content they cover.

1. Basics: environment, types, syntax, matrix operations,  I/O
2. Basics: cells and structs , loops, strings
3. Signal processing + MATLAB toolboxes (Simulating data, Hilbert transforms, filters, FFT)
4. Plotting
5. Data reduction and clustering 
6. Statistics (t-test, permutation tests, AUC/ROC, SDT) 
7. Curve and Model Fitting & Model selection 
8. Machine learning (regressions, SVM)

Each class has slides and accompanying code with examples using freely available data.
Lectures will be over zoom (the link will be sent over email).


















Note:
RPDR data obtained from dragracer package in R

Face images obtained from: https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset 

I do not own any of the images used in this repository, they are simply used as examples
